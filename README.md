Spins flax into bowstring in Lumbridge


This is just a starting script. Please don't judge me :(


TODO:
	Clean the code, seriously, organize and comment all the methods.
	
	Create a paint (and an few classes for calculating GP/h, XP gained, etc...)
	
	Objects need their own enum
	
	Objects need modelled for more accurate clicking so we can get rid waiting for player to be out of motion.
	
	Better 'move' closer clicking.
	
	Better banking.
	
	Overall, the entire script will need to re-written before it's considered "decent".
